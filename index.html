          <h1>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h1>
          <div id="AboutText">
            <b>Climate_ART allows users to connect to a shared planet to explore power plants' and their 
              CO2 emissions. The project uses a learn by doing approach where each connected user will leave 
              a footprint for the next users to build on.</b>
            <br></br>
            The project has been ongoing for a period of six weeks. The first two weeks included brainstorming 
            and definition of the project and it’s scoop. Followed by three sprints, one week long each, where 
            the focus has been on product development. The last week of the project focused on putting the 
            last pieces together and displaying the project for users. During the project the aim has been 
            to learn more about graphics and multiplayer interactions. While the motivation for the project 
            actually came from employees at Tom Tits that suggested the theme of “The future of learning about 
            STEM”. One of the learning objectives in the Swedish school curriculum is learning about energy 
            sources and its effect on the environment. With the COP26 taking place during this fall we felt 
            that this topic was highly relevant to work with. 
            <br></br>
            The project has been centered around three main goals:
            <li>Create an interactive and collaborative experience between platforms</li>
            <li>Create a cool and visually pleasing experience </li>
            <li>Create a good learning experience about the climate</li>

          <h1>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE APP</h1>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="TextBox">
              During the first week of the development process the main focus was to develop a MVP that 
              allowed connections between multiple platforms and displayed simpler graphics. We used 
              <b>Node.js</b> to run it and <b>Socket.io</b> to allow the connection between multiple 
              platforms, which in this case was a running Unity project and internet browsers. The 
              <b>Unity</b> project displayed a simpler 3D world while the browsers showed an interactive 
              2D map over the world, by the help of <b>Leaflet.js</b>. If the user taped the map a tree 
              would be placed and the user could see the tree being dropped in the 3D world. 
              <br></br>
              When it was time to branch out on the MVP we had three areas: the graphics, the interaction and 
              the logic. For the graphics part a larger and more detailed 3D world was created in 
              <b>Blender</b> and later on exported to Unity. More 3D models, like power plants and nature 
              objects were also created and added. Some objects like the water and electrical cables needed 
              shading and these were scripted. For the interaction we allowed the user to choose between 
              multiple objects to place on the map. To make sure the interface was mobile responsive we used 
              <b>Onsen UI</b> and their components. The user was also asked to enter an alias when entering 
              the page to tell who did what interactions and display that for the other users. And for the 
              logic part we added more things in Unity, like a graph displayed on the larger screen, to show 
              all users how their different interactions affected the CO2 emissions, and a bar that gave an 
              overview to what energy sources that was used. To give a more alive and responsive world we 
              integrated a day and night cycle and if the CO2 emissions were too high a fog appeared. 
              <br></br>
              When the project was displayed to users we deployed the project with the help of a 
              <b>Raspberry Pi</b> and the users scanned a <b>QR code</b>, leading to the deployed website, 
              to join. That allowed everyone to use their own phone in a very efficient way.

          Most integrations have been pretty seamless for us. One of few challenging parts has been to extract 
          models from Blender to Unity. There were many materials we couldn’t extract and had to add in Unity 
          instead. One time we also had a huge problem with the vectors in the extraction. which made half of 
          the world turn inside out. Otherwise this project has been a good project to learn more about creating 
          shaders and work with very cute low-poly style graphics. Which was also a style of the graphics that 
          was liked by the users, we learned during the users feedback. 
          <br></br>
          Since we decided to work with a very complex topic, the environment, there’s a lot of future 
          implementations and work to be done. We had to scoop the project and focus on just a few things 
          even if we had a lot of ideas and things we wanted to try out - a challenge but also something you 
          need to practice. In the end we saw that this project serves as a very good proof of concept and 
          could be expanded a lot in areas like education, collaboration and exploration.
